# Sorting
Seeing if I can write a sorting algorithm without googling how to. Going to sort a list rather than a dataframe (I think)

Plan
+ ~~see if I can write a bubble sort
+ try to improve on that
+ run comparisons of my algorithms and the standard sorting algorithm (and maybe some randome ones on the internet)
  + generate random list of numbers of a given length
  + time how long it takes to sort
  + graph/table outputs

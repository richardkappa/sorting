# Sorting
Seeing if I can write a sorting algorithm without googling how to.

## Plan
+ ~~see if I can write a bubble sort~~
+ try to improve on that
  + I've sort of done this
+ ~~run comparisons of my algorithms and the standard sorting algorithm (and maybe some randome ones on the internet)~~
  + ~~generate random list of numbers of a given length~~
  + ~~time how long it takes to sort~~
  + ~~graph/table outputs~~

## Layout
The file "Initial Sorting Tests.ipynb" contains my attempts at making and testing sorting algorithms in python and then testing them

## Functions
+ find_biggest = compares two numbers and returns the bigger one
+ RKA_Bubblesort = my bubble sort
+ SO_Bubble = a better version of bubble sort from stack overflow
+ SO_Sort = a sorting method from stack overflow
+ RKA_Bubblesort2 = a slightly improved version of my bubble sort
